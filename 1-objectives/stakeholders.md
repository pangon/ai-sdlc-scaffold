# Stakeholders

Everyone with a stake in the system: those who use it, fund it, maintain it, or are affected by it. Every requirement should trace back to a stakeholder need.

## Influence Levels

- **High** — can approve or veto decisions; priority conflicts resolved in their favor
- **Medium** — consulted during review; concerns addressed but may be overruled
- **Low** — informed of decisions; needs considered but not blocking
