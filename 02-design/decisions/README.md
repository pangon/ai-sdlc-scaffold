# Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)

High-level technology and design decisions. Each ADR documents a significant architectural choice, the options considered, and the rationale for the decision.

These are **not** implementation-level decisions (which live in `03-code/decisions/`). ADRs capture choices about technology, patterns, and system design that shape the overall architecture.
